16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,

## Limitations and disclamer
*The script is not perfect and do not work with all scriptures. Fx. if there is mention at number in the bible vers the script will convert those numbers too. The unicode caractors also do not display correct in all fonts, so not all fonts do have these caractors, many have 1, 2 and 3 but not the rest fx.*
